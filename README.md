## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a **monorepo architecture** where the frontend and backend logic reside in a single codebase. It leverages **Next.js API Routes** to integrate the backend functionality directly within the Next.js frontend application.

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, deployed on Vercel.
- **Backend Logic**: Implemented using Next.js API Routes (Node.js/TypeScript), deployed alongside the frontend on Vercel. This layer interacts with the database via **Prisma ORM**.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase.
- **Deployment**: The entire application (frontend + API) is deployed as a single unit on Vercel, connecting to the external Supabase database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building web applications, providing server-side rendering, API routes, and static site generation capabilities.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling component-based UI development.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability through static type checking.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs directly in your HTML.
- **shadcn/ui**: A collection of beautiful and accessible UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, offering ready-to-use UI primitives.
- **Prisma ORM**: An open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that makes database access easy with type-safe queries, used to interact with PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)**: A powerful, open-source relational database system. Supabase provides a managed PostgreSQL instance, simplifying database hosting and management.
- **bcryptjs**: A library used for hashing passwords, ensuring user authentication is secure by storing encrypted passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: A standard for creating access tokens that assert claims (like user identity) in a secure way, used for user authentication sessions.
- **csurf**: A middleware for Express.js (used in Next.js API Routes) that provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, enhancing application security.
- **Recharts**: A composable charting library built with React and D3, used for rendering interactive data visualizations in the admin dashboard.
- **date-fns**: A modern JavaScript date utility library that provides a comprehensive, yet simple and consistent toolset for manipulating dates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaliartnaa/sea-catering.git
cd sea-catering
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables Configuration üîê

Create a `.env` file in the project root (sea-catering/). This file will contain sensitive information and should NOT be pushed to public Git repositories.

```env
# Environment Variables for SEA Catering Application

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF]:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres"
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
```

> Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_REF]`, `[YOUR_PASSWORD]`, and `YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE` with your actual Supabase project details and secret key.

> How to generate your JWT_SECRET if you confused:  
> `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`

### 4. Database Setup & Migrations üóÑÔ∏è

After configuring your `.env` file, run Prisma migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_setup
npx prisma generate
```

### 5. Seed Initial Data (Optional) üå±

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

### 6. Start the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Vercel

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. In the Vercel dashboard, add the following environment variables:

   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`
   - `JWT_SECRET`

4. Ensure these variables are available at both **Build** and **Runtime** scopes
5. Vercel will deploy automatically on push to `main` branch

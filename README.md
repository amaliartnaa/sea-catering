## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Local Development

- Make sure the **backend** is also running (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`)
- The app uses **HTTP-only cookies** for auth, which can cause issues if switching ports or switching between http/https
- Next.js **rewrites** proxy `/api` to the backend, resolving SameSite issues
- If login doesn't persist after refresh, clear cookies or check `.env` setup

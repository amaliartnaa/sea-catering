# SEA Catering Application 🍱

Welcome to the **SEA Catering** project! This repository contains the complete **full-stack application**, encompassing both the frontend user interface and the backend API logic. The application allows users to explore healthy meal plans, customize their orders, manage subscriptions, submit testimonials, and provides an administrative dashboard for business insights.

This project is built with a modern and efficient stack, ensuring a smooth, responsive, and secure experience for all users.

## 🏛️ Architecture

This project follows a **monorepo architecture** where the frontend and backend logic reside in a single codebase. It leverages **Next.js API Routes** to integrate the backend functionality directly within the Next.js frontend application.

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, deployed on Vercel.
- **Backend Logic**: Implemented using Next.js API Routes (Node.js/TypeScript), deployed alongside the frontend on Vercel. This layer interacts with the database via **Prisma ORM**.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase.
- **Deployment**: The entire application (frontend + API) is deployed as a single unit on Vercel, connecting to the external Supabase database.

## ⚙️ Installation & Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaliartnaa/sea-catering.git
cd sea-catering
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables Configuration 🔐

Create a `.env` file in the project root (sea-catering/). This file will contain sensitive information and should NOT be pushed to public Git repositories.

```env
# Environment Variables for SEA Catering Application

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF]:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres"
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
```

To get the values for these variables, follow these steps:

# --- Getting Supabase Database Connection Strings ---

# 1. Log in to your Supabase Dashboard:
#    Go to [console.supabase.com/](https://console.supabase.com/) and log in.

# 2. Select your project.

# 3. Navigate to Project Settings:
#    Click the gear icon (Project Settings) in the sidebar.
#    Then, select "Database".

# 4. Find the "Connection string" section:
#    You will see two crucial URIs here:

#    a. For DATABASE_URL (Pooler, Transaction mode):
#       Copy the "URI" provided under "Pooler" (Transaction mode).
#       Example format: postgresql://postgres.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF]:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@[aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres](https://aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres)
#       This is the connection string your running application (Next.js API Routes) will use.

#    b. For DIRECT_DATABASE_URL (Direct Connection):
#       Copy the "URI" provided under "Direct Connection".
#       Example format: postgresql://postgres.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF]:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
#       This is specifically used by Prisma CLI tools (like `npx prisma migrate dev`, `npx prisma generate`, `pnpm run db:seed`)
#       for direct database operations.

# 5. Identify [YOUR_PROJECT_REF] and [YOUR_PASSWORD]:
#    - [YOUR_PROJECT_REF] is the unique identifier found within both URIs (e.g., "hlrftyxknskphvlkaqgw").
#    - [YOUR_PASSWORD] is the database password you set when you initially created your Supabase project.

# --- Generating JWT_SECRET ---

# 1. Open your terminal.

# 2. Run the following Node.js command:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# 3. Copy the generated hexadecimal string.
#    Use this strong, random string as your JWT_SECRET.

### 4. Database Setup & Migrations 🗄️

After configuring your `.env` file, run Prisma migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_setup
npx prisma generate
```

### 5. Seed Initial Data (Optional) 🌱

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

### 6. Start the Application ▶️

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ☁️ Deployment to Vercel

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. In the Vercel dashboard, add the following environment variables:

   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`
   - `JWT_SECRET`

4. Ensure these variables are available at both **Build** and **Runtime** scopes
5. Vercel will deploy automatically on push to `main` branch

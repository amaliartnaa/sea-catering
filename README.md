## 🏛️ Architecture

This project follows a **monorepo architecture** where the frontend and backend logic reside in a single codebase. It leverages **Next.js API Routes** to integrate the backend functionality directly within the Next.js frontend application.

* **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, deployed on Vercel.
* **Backend Logic**: Implemented using Next.js API Routes (Node.js/TypeScript), deployed alongside the frontend on Vercel. This layer interacts with the database via **Prisma ORM**.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase.
* **Deployment**: The entire application (frontend + API) is deployed as a single unit on Vercel, connecting to the external Supabase database.

## ⚙️ Installation & Local Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaliartnaa/sea-catering.git
cd sea-catering
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables Configuration 🔐

Create a `.env` file in the project root (`sea-catering/`). This file contains sensitive credentials and should **never be committed** to version control.

#### 📂 How to Configure Supabase with Prisma

1. Go to [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com) and open your project.
2. In the sidebar, navigate to **Project Settings → Database**.
3. Click the **ORMs** tab.
4. Scroll to the section titled **`.env.local`** and copy its content.
5. Paste it into your project’s `.env` file.
6. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual **database password** (from the Connection Info section).

#### ✅ Example `.env`

```env
# Connection pooling (used by Prisma Client at runtime)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.hlrftyxknskphvlkaqgw:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Direct connection (for migrations and CLI commands)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.hlrftyxknskphvlkaqgw:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# JWT secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET="your_random_secret_key"
```

#### 🧠 Ensure `prisma/schema.prisma` is configured correctly

Make sure your Prisma schema includes the following configuration to support both connection pooling and direct database access:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

#### 🔐 Generate JWT Secret

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 4. Database Setup & Migrations 🗄️

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_setup
npx prisma generate
```

### 5. Seed Initial Data (Optional) 🌱

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

### 6. Start the Application ▶️

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

2. Connect your repository to Vercel

3. In the Vercel dashboard, add the following environment variables:

   * `DATABASE_URL`
   * `DIRECT_URL`
   * `JWT_SECRET`

4. Ensure these variables are available at both **Build** and **Runtime** scopes

5. Vercel will deploy automatically on push to `main` branch
